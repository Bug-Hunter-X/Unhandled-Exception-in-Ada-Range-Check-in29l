This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: overly broad exception handling that masks potential runtime errors. The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides a corrected version with improved exception handling. The improved version demonstrates specific exception handling for constraints errors, provides more informative error messages, and uses assertions to aid in testing.
